*************************** BackUp ***************************
  sudo mkdir /var/backups/mongobackups
  sudo mongodump --db newdb --out /var/backups/mongobackups/`date +"%m-%d-%y"`
Explaination
   --out which specifies the directory in which the data will be dumped. 
   Let's take an example with backing up the newdb database and storing it in the /var/backups/mongobackups directory. 
   Ideally, we'll have each of our backups in a directory with the current date like /var/backups/mongobackups/10-05-18.(05 oct 2018 )

*************************** Regular(Incremental)BackUp *************************** 

1. Set mongodump command as cron job to run it regularly

Linux Crontab Format
MIN HOUR DOM MON DOW CMD

Field    Description    Allowed Value
MIN      Minute field    0 to 59
HOUR     Hour field      0 to 23
DOM      Day of Month    1-31
MON      Month field     1-12
DOW      Day Of Week     0-6
CMD      Command         Any command to be executed.



2. To accomplish this open crontab editor as
  sudo crontab -e
3. for example we want to take regular back up of mongod every day @ 5:30 am then insert the following command in crontab editor
  30 5 * * * mongodump --out /var/backups/mongobackups/`date +"%m-%d-%y"`
  
  Note: if --db argument is not provided, it takes backup of all mongo databases

*************************** Deleting older BackUp *************************** 
For example, to delete all the backups older than 7 days you can use the following bash command:
  find /var/backups/mongobackups/ -mtime +7 -exec rm -rf {} \;

Similarly to the previous mongodump command, this one can be also added as a cron job. 
It should run just before you start the next backup, e.g. at 05:01 AM. For this purpose open again crontab:

  sudo crontab -e
  1 5 * * * find /var/backups/mongobackups/ -mtime +7 -exec rm -rf {} \;
